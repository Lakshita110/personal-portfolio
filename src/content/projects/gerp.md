#### Overview

For the final project of my CS15 Data Structures course in the spring of 2023 we completed a CLI tool project named "gerp" based off the UNIX tool grep which can search through all the files in a directory and look for a sequence of characters. This project required extensive use of data structures such as arraylists, linkedlists, hash tables and more. With the large datasets given, tiem and space complexities of our program were of utmost importance.
