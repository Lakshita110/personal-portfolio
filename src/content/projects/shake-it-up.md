#### Overview

In the summer of 2021, me and a friend decided to participate a <a href="https://devpost.com/software/bon-hacketit-project"> food-themed hackathon </a>. As we created this project in the middle of the pandemic, we thought about a lot of people missing Friday nights out and wanted to create something that would be fun and allow people to experience that from home. Our website used the <a href="https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php"> CocktailDB API </a> to provide cocktail and mocktail recipes which could be filtered by ingredients and name. 

#### Tech Stack
The website was built and deployed using:
- Ruby on Rails
- Bootstrap Studio 
- Heroku
